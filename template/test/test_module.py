"""Unittest module. Note that unit tests is designed to test the
internal structure of the program, therefore knowledge about the
design can be (and it is recommended to be) used.

This includes for example, the edit and assert of private module
and class variables.

Also note that the usage of files for setup, might produce files
on the root directory when a test fails if a dir mockup is not
used.
